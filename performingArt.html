                        media market is expected to grow from $1712.96 billion in 2020 to $1850.04 billion in 2021 at a
                        compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8%. The independent artists and performing art companies
                        expected to reach $181.39 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 16.2%, twice of media market. The Indian
                        media market is projected to reach $39 bn by 2024 at a CAGR of 9% and performing art is expected
                        to reach by $3.7 bn. </p>

                    <p>• M&E industry is growing but struggling for suitable content for its customers as evident with
                        higher growth of digital content (12% against overall media of 8%). Other hand, the traditional
                        / performing art segment and budding artists have huge and diversified multilingual content.
                    </p>
                    <p>• Considering the grow of the media sector and hunger for audience friendly content in one hand,
                        and the huge available content in traditional performing art sector, there is need of present
                        the traditional performing art for modern diverse customers. The sector seems to be unorganized,
                        as there is mismatch between the customers/ demand and suppliers/ artists. Event management
                        companies might be facilitating between two in local level but they may also lack standards and
                        access to both demand and supply sides. </p>

                        traditional performing art. The study includes 106 artists across the country, 15 film makers
                        and customers as well as secondary research. Traditional performing art is watched by over 60%
                        at least weekly and 80% of artists want to watch in original form, and 75% also open for fusion.
                        They are keen to watch the such art as 40% are enthusiasts, 35% are nostalgia, remaining use it
                        for education and spiritual purpose. </p>
